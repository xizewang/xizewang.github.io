### 100-m resolution Age-Stratified Population Estimation from the 2020 China Census by Township (ASPECT)
<i>Introduction</i>


Gridded population datasets are instrumental for modeling the interactions between human and the environment at fine spatial scales. Here, we introduce an Age-Stratified Population Estimation from the 2020 China Census by Township (ASPECT), estimating total population and population by age groups (0-14, 15-59, 60-64, ≥65 years old) at 100m spatial resolution as of year 2020. We used a dasymetric mapping approach to downscale township-level population data (n=40,718 townships) from the 2020 China Census to 100 by 100 m grid cells. The study area is mainland China.
