Dr. Xize WANG is an assistant professor at the [Department of Real Estate](https://bizfaculty.nus.edu.sg/faculty-details/?profId=672) of National University of Singapore (NUS). He is also a faculty affiliate of [NUS Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS)](https://ireus.nus.edu.sg/) and [NUS Centre for Family and Population Research (CFPR)](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cfpr/). 

His research interests lie in identifying evidence-based, innovative policy tools to make cities healthier and more sustainable, with a particular focus on: (1) urban environment and health, and (2) sustainable mobility. His research, which appears in leading journals such as <i>Urban Studies</i>, <i>Transport Research Part A</i>, and <i>Transport Research Part D</i>, establishes theoretical and empirical connections between the household-scale urban environment and mental health, as well as examines the effects on demographic and urban health factors in shaping sustainable transport policy.

He is currently an editorial board member of <i>[Journal of Urban Health](https://link.springer.com/journal/11524)</i> and <i>[Transportation Research Part D](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/transportation-research-part-d-transport-and-environment)</i>. Prior to NUS, he has been a postdoctoral scholar at University of California, Berkeley. He received a Ph.D. in Urban Planning & Development at University of Southern California, a Master in Urban & Regional Planning at University of Minnesota, and a B.E. in Urban Planning and a B.A. in Economics in 2010 at Peking University, where he was a recipient of China’s National Scholarship.

## Selected Publications

**Home-Made Blues: Residential Crowding and Mental Health in Beijing, China**\
(with Tao Liu)\
<i>Urban Studies, Vol. 60</i>(3), pp. 461-482, 2023.\
[Read more](https://xizewang.github.io/publication/2023-02-01-us-dep10-crowding) \| [PDF](https://xizewang.github.io/files/2023-02-01-us-dep10-crowding.pdf) \| [Journal (Open Access)](https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980221101707)\
<i> Summary:</i> Living in a crowded place – measured by both sqm per person and persons per bedroom – is significantly associated with a higher risk of depression. Residential crowding is associated with depression by serving as a direct stressor rather than triggering higher life stress. 


**The roads one must walk down: Commute and depression for Beijing’s residents**\
(with Tao Liu)\
<i>Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, Vol. 109</i>, 103316, 2022.\
[Read more](https://xizewang.github.io/publication/2022-06-22-trd-depression-commute) \| [PDF](https://xizewang.github.io/files/2022-06-22-trd-depression-commute.pdf) \| [Journal (Open Access)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2022.103316)\
<i> Summary:</i> Those taking longer time to work have higher risks for depression - especially for motorcycle/moped takers, older people and blue-collar workers. \

**Life expectancy and mortality in 363 cities of Latin America**\
(as a part of the SALURBAL Group)\
<i>Nature Medicine, Vol. 27</i>(3), pp. 463-470, 2021.\
[Read more](https://xizewang.github.io/publication/2021-01-25-natmed-lac-mortality) \| [PDF](https://xizewang.github.io/files/2021-01-25-natmed-lac-mortality.pdf) \| [Journal (Open Access)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01214-4)\
<i> Summary:</i> Using a harmonized dataset from multiple sources, we describe variability and predictors of life expectancy and proportionate mortality in 363 cities across nine Latin American countries.

**Has the relationship between urban and suburban automobile travel changed across generations? Comparing Millennials and Generation Xers in the United States**\
<i>Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, Vol. 129</i>, pp. 107-122, 2019.\
[Read more](https://xizewang.github.io/publication/2019-08-20-tra-nhts) \| [SocArxiv (Free)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2y5vj) \| [Link to Journal](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2019.08.012)\
<i> Summary:</i> By tracking Millennials’ and Gen Xers’ driving behavior over three decades, I find that Millennials’ lower automobility cannot be fully attributed to urban living, recession or delayed life-cycles. Demographic theory suggests that such generational differences may remain in later life stages.
