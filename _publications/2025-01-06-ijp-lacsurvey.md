**Abstract:**
Harmonized health data sources in Latin America for research and action are limited. The SALURBAL (Salud Urbana en America Latina/Urban Health in Latin America) health survey data resource was created as part of an integrated, comprehensive resource to characterize and study the drivers of urban health in middle-income countries in Latin America. This resource is the largest in scope and size in cities in Latin America. It includes harmonized health survey data from 40 surveys from 11 countries. Survey years ranged from 2000 to 2021, the range of surveys per country is one to six, with seven out of the 11 countries having more than one survey. The total number of adults included in the resource is 721 099 (with sociodemographic data) and 542,336 with select health-related outcomes. For children (aged 0–17), the samples are 209,379 and 134,833, respectively. Data available for adults include individual-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, alcohol/tobacco use, anthropometry, diet, physical activity, diabetes, hypertension, mental health and self-reported health for adults. For children, data include household-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and individual-level anthropometry. City-level, model-based prevalence estimates for selected health risk factors are available as part of this resource. This data resource can be linked to built, natural and social environment data for select geographies [cities, subcity units (e.g. counties) and neighbourhoods).
