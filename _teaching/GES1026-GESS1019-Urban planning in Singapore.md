An introductary module for students from all majors on the nature of urban planning, basic planning models and theories, and their applications in the Singapore context. 

Overview
======
This module aims to give students an understanding of the nature of urban planning, basic planning models and theories, and their applications. Urban planning will be discussed, in the context of national development, urbanization and globalization, as an important force shaping modern human settlements. In Singapore, urban planning is also an important policy instrument to achieve the city-stateâ€™s sustainable development goals. The module will include a study of the institutional aspects of planning, and will discuss issues of plan implementation, the major challenges, constraints and opportunities. Major topics to be covered include: planning history and theory (planning history and pioneers, utopian planning concepts); planning practice in Singapore (strategic planning, land use planning, development control); and selected specific topics of planning (participation, transportation, and heritage conservation). The context of Singapore will provide the backdrop for discussion and critical thinking of the application of theories and principles.
